![Titanic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/RMS_Titanic_3.jpg/600px-RMS_Titanic_3.jpg)  
*A machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic (Kaggle Competition).*

## 📌 Overview
This project tackles Kaggle's ["Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition. It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training/evaluation
- Submission file generation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (or Python script)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook titanic-survival.ipynb

🔍 Key Steps
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)

Converted categorical features (Sex, Embarked)

Feature Engineering:

Created FamilySize from SibSp + Parch

Extracted Title from Name

Modeling:

Compared Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost

📊 Results
Best model: Random Forest
